In order to determine the error in the Powheg calculations, various parameters were varied to give a sense of the overall variation in the results.  The parameters varied were {\tt muref} (the reference scale), {\tt facscfact} (the factorization scale factor), {\tt renscfact} (the renormalization scale factor) and {\tt bbscalevar} (which controls the method of calculating another scale (maybe bb scale?)).  Powheg was used to generate $10^{6}$ $Z\rightarrow ee$ events with the default settings, but with the variables above varied.  The values used for the variables are shown in figure \ref{fig1}.  The output is then fed into the default CMS Pythia6 hadronizer with the default tune.  Finally, the the $p_{T}$ distribution is extracted using the EffAcc analyzer.  The plots are made at truth level, the MUON-MUON acceptance is used and a mass cut is applied to the invariant mass of $60 GeV < M < 120 GeV$.  The plots are normalized to account for the number of events and the varied bin width.  Figure \ref{p1} shows the change in the $Z_{0}$ $p_{t}$ distribution.  The plots show the ratio of the perturbed value of the plot to the default value.  The variables {\tt muref} and {\tt bbscalevar} have little to no effect from the given variations.  The scale factors {\tt facscfact} and {\tt renscfact} on the other hand give a noticable variation in the $p_{t}$ distribution.  Because of this they have been plotted with 10 million generated events instead of 1 million.  The largest variations from the factorization scale factor are approximately 9\% while those from the renormalization scale are around 3\% for the highest $p_{t}$ (though the errors in this determination are largest here).

The Pythia hadronizer was also checked to determine its effect.  For this test a single sample of 10 million Powheg events was created with the default settings.  This same sample was then hadronized with Pythia using 5 optimized tunes (D6T, P0, ProQ20, ProPT0, and Z2).  Again the EffAcc analyzer is used to extract the $p_{t}$ distribution.  The results are plotted in figure \ref{p2}.  Given the Powheg as an input the Pythia hadronization model clearly has only a very small effect on the $p_{t}$ distribution.  This also means that the results for variation of the Powheg scale factors should not be highly effected by the choice of Pythia models either.
